<h3 class="small-padded-bottom  center-text">Below are the questions we have been asked about our afternoon dances so far</h3>
<h5><strong>Will there be Bus Stop/Taxi/Queue Dances?</strong></h5>
<h6>No</h6>
<h5><strong>Will there be Sequence Dancing?</strong></h5>
<h6>For our Evening Dances there generally will be 8 Sequence dances spread throught the evening. Our Afternoon Dances seldom have Sequence dances</h6>
<h5><strong>Will there be Snowballs?</strong></h5>
<h6>No</h6>
<h5><strong>Is the Afternoon Dance a Tea Dance?</strong></h5>
<h6>That depends on what you expect from a Tea dance. It is a dance in the afternoon and Tea is available. We purposefully called it a Social Dance rather than a Tea Dance so that people did not pre-judge it as something that it may or may not be.</h6>
<h5><strong>Do I need a partner?</strong></h5>
<h6>Although it is open to anybody in reality only those with partners or a group attended. </h6>
<h5><strong>For the Afternoon Dance is Tea and Coffee included in th eprice?</strong></h5>
<h6>No, we tried to keep the entrane price low and those that want Tea or Coffee can buy it for 50p. There will be free water and squash. You can bring your own drinks and nibbles.</h6>	
<h5><strong>What level of dancers are you expecting or targeting?</strong></h5>
<h6>Social Dancers of any standard are welcome, as long as you like Ballroom and Latin dancing it does not matter if you are complete beginners or at Gold or beyond. It is a social dance and not for those that want to practice for competitions </h6>
<h5><strong>Where is the hall?</strong></h5>
<h6>The hall for the evening dance is not advertised as by invitation only at this stage (but is in the SM7 post code area). We are looking for a new hall for the afternoons, the one we used to use was at 122 Ladbroke Road, Redhill, RH1 1LF and maybe we will be able to go back there  <a href="http://streetmap.co.uk/grid/528299_151205/" target="_blank" >Show Map</a></h6>
<h5><strong>Is there parking?</strong></h5>
<h6>There is ample parking for the Evening dance although people often drive past the entrance, it is signed but not well.</h6>
<h5><strong>Can you tell me a bit more about the hall?</strong></h5>
<h6>These are the deatils of the old hall, we will update this section when the Evening Dance is made public and/or we find a venue for our Afternoon Dances. St Joseph's hall was built in 2013 and is a large hall with a sprung floor, see Photos, or for more information see the church's website.  <a href="http://www.thenativityofthelord.org.uk/churches/stjosephs/our_community/pnl_centre_stj_room_hire.html" target="_blank" >Church Website</a></h6>
